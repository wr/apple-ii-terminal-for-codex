# Install or update the disk image on a FloppyEmu SD card. macOS-only
# (dot_clean, mdutil, stat -f); on Linux/Windows copy the image onto a
# freshly formatted FAT32 card, or overwrite the existing file in place.
#
# FloppyEmu requires each image file to be CONTIGUOUS on the card's FAT
# filesystem, and macOS makes that surprisingly hard (verified by reading
# the FAT directly - see tools/fatmap.py):
#   - macOS's FAT driver allocates first-fit from the front of the card, so
#     once deleted files have left holes, a fresh copy is shredded into them.
#   - Spotlight/.fseventsd/AppleDouble "._*" writes interleave with a copy
#     and split it even on an otherwise-clean card.
# Strategy:
#   - update:  if the image already exists on the card at the same size,
#              overwrite IN PLACE (dd conv=notrunc). Cluster layout is
#              reused, so a file the Emu already loads keeps loading.
#   - install: copy with xattrs stripped (no "._*" twin) + dot_clean.
#   - repair:  copy every file off, wipe (except SIP-protected dirs), copy
#              back in one pass. Frees holes and repacks contiguously.
#              Run once if the Emu reports "file not contiguous".
#
# Usage:
#   tools/install-sd.sh [image.dsk] [/Volumes/CARD]
#   tools/install-sd.sh --repair [/Volumes/CARD]
