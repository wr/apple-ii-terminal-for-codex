# Apple II terminal setup (text-mode path)

This is the simpler alternative to the native IIgs graphics client: any Apple
II with a terminal program (or the IIc's built-in firmware terminal) talking
plain 40/80-column text to the bridge. Run the bridge **without** `--app` for
this path. If you have a IIgs and want the full Claude Code-style UI, see the
main [README](../README.md) instead.

How to get your IIgs or IIc talking to the bridge. Two paths: a **serial cable**
(works on both machines) or a **WiFi modem / network** (IIgs).

Start with serial — it's the fewest moving parts.

## Serial: the cable

The Apple II serial ports are RS-422 (the same family as classic Mac serial),
not RS-232. To reach a modern host you need a USB-serial adapter and the right
cable for your machine's connector:

| Machine            | Connector        | Cable                                                            |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IIgs**           | mini-DIN-8       | A "Mac serial to USB" FTDI cable works directly (IIgs serial is Mac-compatible RS-422). |
| **IIc Plus**       | mini-DIN-8       | Same as the IIgs.                                                |
| **Original IIc**   | 5-pin DIN (DIN-5)| Needs a DIN-5 cable/adapter — not the same as the IIgs. Retro-computing sellers (e.g. the A2 community) make these; or wire your own from the pinout below. |

RS-422 is differential and RS-232 is single-ended, but at these baud rates the
common trick works fine: connect the II's TXD- to the adapter's RX, RXD- to the
adapter's TX, ground to ground, and tie the unused differential legs to ground.
A proper RS-422↔RS-232 adapter is cleaner if you have one.

If you're buying rather than wiring: search for an "Apple IIgs serial USB cable"
(mini-DIN-8) or an "Apple IIc modem cable" (DIN-5) — these are sold ready-made.

### IIgs / IIc Plus mini-DIN-8 pinout (the port, looking at the machine)

```
   pin 3  TXD-   -> adapter RXD
   pin 5  RXD-   -> adapter TXD
   pin 4  GND    -> adapter GND
   pin 8  RXD+   -> tie to GND
   pin 6  TXD+   -> leave / tie to GND
   pin 1  HSKo (RTS)  -> adapter CTS   (only if using --rtscts)
   pin 2  HSKi (CTS)  -> adapter RTS   (only if using --rtscts)
```

Use **port 2 (modem)** on the IIgs by convention. Port 1 is the printer port;
it also works.

## Serial: settings on both sides

Set the Apple II terminal program and the bridge to match. A good starting point:

- **9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)**
- Local echo **OFF** (the bridge echoes what you type)
- Flow control: none to start

Bridge side:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r bridge/requirements-serial.txt
python3 bridge/bridge.py --serial /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXX --baud 9600 \
  --cols 80 --backend code
```

Bump to `--baud 19200` once it's stable (the IIc's 6551 tops out around there;
the IIgs can go faster). At higher baud, add flow control on both sides:
`--rtscts` if your cable has the handshake lines wired, otherwise `--xonxoff`.
If Claude's replies drop characters and you have no flow control, throttle the
bridge with `--pace-cps 600`.

## Terminal software

### IIgs

Use a real comms program, booted from whatever storage you have (FloppyEmu,
BlueSCSI, real disks):

- **ProTERM**, **Spectrum**, or **Talk Is Cheap** are the classics.
- Set the connection to the serial port you wired (modem port), 9600 8N1,
  local echo off.
- Terminal emulation: plain **TTY/glass-tty** is safest. The bridge sends only
  ASCII and CR/LF, so you don't need ANSI or VT100. If your program defaults to
  VT100, that's fine too.

### IIc

The IIc has no slots, so it's serial or nothing — which is perfect here.

- **ProTERM** runs on the IIc and is the reliable choice. 9600 8N1, echo off.
- **No-disk option:** the serial firmware has a built-in terminal mode. From the
  `]` prompt, type `IN#2` and press Return, then press **Control-A** followed by
  **T**. Keyboard now goes out the port and received bytes print to the screen,
  with BASIC out of the loop. Exit with **Control-A** then **Q**.

  Set the port to 9600 8N1 first via the command character if needed:
  `Control-A` `1` `4` `B` `Return` (9600 baud); 8N1 is already the default.
  Don't use `IN#2` alone — that hands each received line to BASIC and you get
  `?SYNTAX ERROR`. (Serial command character is Control-A on the modem port.)

## WiFi modem / telnet (IIgs)

Modem-side setup — cables per machine, WiFi join and phone-book commands for
WiModem 232 / WiFi232 / Zimodem, and a troubleshooting checklist — lives in
[docs/MODEM-SETUP.md](../docs/MODEM-SETUP.md).

If you have an ESP-based WiFi modem (Zimodem/RetroWiFi style) or an Uthernet II:

1. Run the bridge as a TCP server on your host:

   ```sh
   python3 bridge.py --telnet --port 6400 --cols 80
   ```

2. From the II's terminal program, dial the bridge. With a WiFi-modem in command
   mode, telnet to the host's IP:

   ```
   ATDT192.168.1.50:6400
   ```

   (Replace with your host's LAN IP.) A plain telnet client works too.

3. If you use a raw `telnet` client (not a modem passing bytes through), add
   `--telnet-negotiate` to the bridge so it answers the telnet option handshake
   and its negotiation bytes don't show up as garbage.

Raw terminal programs do not store the native client's token, so they must
enter the code shown on the bridge console for each new session.

The bridge listens for one connection at a time. Reconnect and it picks up the
next caller.

## KEGS emulator (no hardware)

KEGS routes each emulated serial port to a TCP socket, so you can test without a
cable. Press **F4** → Serial Port Configuration and set **Slot 2** to one of:

- **Incoming** — KEGS listens on TCP **6502**. Dial in from the host:

  ```sh
  python3 bridge.py --connect 127.0.0.1:6502 --cols 80
  ```

  This is the simplest option. Inside KEGS, use a terminal program on Slot 2, or
  from the Applesoft `]` prompt enter the serial firmware's terminal mode:
  type `IN#2` and press Return, then press **Control-A** followed by **T**. That
  turns the port into a glass terminal (keyboard out, serial in) and stops BASIC
  from parsing the incoming text. Exit with **Control-A** then **Q**.

  Do NOT use `IN#2` alone or `IN#2` + `PR#2` — that feeds each received line to
  the BASIC interpreter and you get `?SYNTAX ERROR` on every line.

- **Virtual modem** — KEGS dials out like a Hayes modem. Run the bridge as a
  server (`python3 bridge.py --telnet --port 8888`) and inside KEGS type
  `ATDT 127.0.0.1:8888`. Set `g_serial_modem_init_telnet = 0` in `config.kegs`
  (or leave the bridge without `--telnet-negotiate`) for a clean raw stream.

Slot 1 uses port 6501; Slot 2 uses 6502. Baud doesn't matter under emulation —
KEGS moves bytes as fast as the socket allows.

## First contact

1. Start the bridge on the host. It prints `waiting...` (telnet) or the serial
   port it opened.
2. Connect from the Apple II.
3. You should see the `CLAUDE ][` banner. Type `/help`.
4. Type a question, press Return. Claude's reply streams in, wrapped to your
   screen width.

If the banner never shows: wrong baud, wrong port, or TX/RX swapped. If you see
the banner but typing does nothing: check that the II's terminal is actually
sending on the same port. If you see doubled letters: local echo is on — turn it
off (or run the bridge with `--no-echo`).
