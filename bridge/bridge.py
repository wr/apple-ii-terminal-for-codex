"""The host half of Terminal for Claude Code (Apple II).

The Apple II is a dumb terminal. This program sits on a modern host, reads the
line you type, sends it to Claude, and streams the reply back word-wrapped for a
40- or 80-column screen.

  Serial (a USB-serial cable into the II's serial port):
      python bridge.py --serial /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXX --baud 9600

  Telnet / WiFi modem (the II dials out over TCP):
      python bridge.py --telnet --port 6400

Backends:
      --backend chat   direct Q&A with Claude (default). Nothing runs on host.
      --backend code   the real `claude` CLI. Edits files and runs commands
                       ON THIS HOST. Switch live with `/mode code`.

Type `/help` on the Apple II once connected.
